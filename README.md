Using skills gained from 'Build Web Apps with Vue JS 3 & Firebase' -- The Net Ninja (Shaun Pelling) üòé
The idea is not mine -- it comes from a website "–°–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏ –º–∞–º—É" (Ask Mom) in Russian web.
I'm just using the idea to practice the skills gained from The Net Ninja's course, and it's my first project in Vue.
